How This Dashboard Was Created
Data Preparation:


Imported the HR dataset into Power BI and reviewed the data fields.
Cleaned the data by addressing any missing values and categorizing variables like "Work-Life Balance" and "Attrition."
Data Modeling:


Established relationships between tables in the dataset for seamless analysis.
Created calculated columns and measures for key metrics, such as attrition rate and average salary.
Visualization Design:


Used a variety of Power BI visuals (e.g., bar charts, line charts, and donut charts) to represent data effectively.
Applied filters and slicers to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
Styling and Layout:


Applied a professional theme with gradient backgrounds for visual appeal.
Organized visuals into sections to ensure the dashboard is intuitive and easy to navigate.
